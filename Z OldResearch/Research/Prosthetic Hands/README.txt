This folder contains scholarly articles on cutting edge prosthetic hands.


HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS FOLDER:

If you're trying to write about this topic, just go through the "State of the Art Hands" document, and that should be everything you need for a state of the art review.

The other article, "Rapid Fabrication of a Non-Assembly Robotic Hand" is MINDBOGGLINGLY COOL and I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU READ IT. It straddles current hand technologies and 3d printing, and absolutely needs to be worked into reports somewhere but I'm not sure how

(Now that I've seen this I fully intend to design our fingers to be printed as non-assembly too)
