This folder contains information on hands, hand muscle structure, skeletal structure, etc



HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS FOLDER:

Proportions of Hand Segments and Relative Lengths of Fingers and Toes were both used to find the goal size for the prosthetic. You can more or less ignore them for any literature review, and instead refer to the goal size document (since all the relevant information will be there).

Anatomy and Mechanics of the Human Hand is good background, you should read through it, but if you're in a rush, you can probably skim bones (maybe compare them to the rigid plastic part of the prosthetic), skim angles of rotation of the wrist, take some time reading and understanding the muscles and tendons part (since that's what we're really modeling here), skip to Fig. 11, resting hand pattern (maybe mention that our resting hand will probably be flat), and then read and understand thumb versatility patterns and hand movements.

Towards a Realistic and Self-Contained Biomechanical Model of the Hand is probably really only valuable for the Musculo-tendon action models and the part on ligaments, you can pretty much skip everything else (though I would reccomend skimming it maybe)

Hand Biomechanics in Skilled Pianists you can pretty much ignore, I put it there because I knew Chris was interested in making it play the piano.
